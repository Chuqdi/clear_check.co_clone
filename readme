NOTE - I have cloned some of the pages on the website home page. I must have missed some. To clone a page 
1. Copy the page link to https://saveweb2zip.com/ and click save 
2. This will get you the website page
3. You then need to link the pages as you wish. The webpages are not linked yet.

Note - I havent linked the pages. You can easily do that on the HTML pages.
